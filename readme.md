This project is a try to map the idea of turing machines using `OOP` with java.

In general, turing machines are theoretical machines that can compute a bunch of different things, and actually can execute all computational software in it.

This idea, was postulated by `Alan Turing`, considered one of the fathers of computer science, in its idea for solving the [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem).

A turing machine can, as simple ways, have 2 parts:

- `infinite tape`: responsible for contain all the symbols, which are `commands` for the machine.
- `reader head`: responsible for read and write in the tape based on the actual instruction.

Every time that the head pass through a symbol, it reads the symbol, and, based on the instruction for that symbol in that `given state`, it writes another symbol and then the machine moves `left` or `right`, and it goes until the last symbol.

The common approach to see that, is using images like these ones:

[![tape](./assets/tape.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
[![machine](./assets/machine.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)

However, a more mathematical way is representing it with an automaton.

[![automaton](./assets/automaton.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)

The elements of this graph are:

- circles: representing the machine states
- arrows: representing the transitions between each state
- labels: are the commands for each transition. These commands follow this pattern: (read)/(instruction),(move).
  - read: is the symbol that we expect to read
  - instruction: what we do when a symbol is reached, (like `P` for print, or you can see this a symbol to rewrite the tape).
  - move: the direction that you'll follow in the tape (`LEFT/RIGHT`)
- two circles: the final state. If your program reach it after passing through all the symbols, your the given input is correct and the program executed successfully.

The head will read symbol-by-symbol following the label instructions. Case your input has a symbol that for the actual state doesn't have a transition for it, the program `crashes`, so this input is not accepted by that given machine configuration.

## Java implementation

For this project, the idea was to try to abstract all this into classes and objects, then gather all it together in a java-library.

For that was used:

- [gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [junit4](https://junit.org/junit4/)
- [jdk8](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)
- [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

Case you want to install it, check the [gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_building_java_libraries.html).

For `ASDF` users, I recommend you check these plugins:

- [java](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java)
- [gradle](https://github.com/rfrancis/asdf-gradle)

For `opensuse` users, I've left a script to install `java` and setup the `JAVA_HOME`, check it [here](./utils/java.sh).  

### Structure

The main structure has 3 elements:

- [Transition](./lib/src/main/java/machine/Transition.java)
- [State](./lib/src/main/java/machine/State.java)
- [Automaton](./lib/src/main/java/machine/Automaton.java)

These have the following methods:

---

#### Transition

| method |  arguments | returns |
|--------|------------|---------|
|constructor|`char read`, `char write`, `Direction direction`, `State next`|-|
|getReadSymbol| - | `char` |
|getAction|-|`Action`|

The direction type is an enum for `LEFT` and `RIGHT`

```java
enum Direction {
    LEFT, RIGHT
}
```

to access it just use:

```java
Direction.LEFT 

or

Direction.RIGHT
```

The Action is an auxiliar class which keeps track of the metadata for a transition, containing:

```java
char write; //symbol to be written
Direction direction; //the tape direction
State next; //the next state
boolean reachedFinal; //if the next state is in the final states set
```

The methods of `Action` are:

| method |  arguments | returns |
|--------|------------|---------|
|constructor|`char read`, `char write`, `State next`, `boolean reachedFinal`|-|
|getWrite| - | `char` |
|getDirection|-|`Direction`|
|getNext|-|`State`|
|getReachedFinal|-|`boolean`|

---

#### State

| method |  arguments | returns |throws|
|--------|------------|---------|------|
|constructor|`String id`|-|-|
|constructor|`String id`, `ArrayList<Transition> transitions`|-|-|
|constructor|`String id`, `ArrayList<Transition> transitions`, `boolean firstState`, `boolean finalState`|-|-|
|addTransition| `Transition transition` | - |-|
|setFinal|-|-|-|
|setFirst|-|-|-|
|isFinal|-|`boolean`|-|
|isFirst|-|`boolean`|
|getId|-|`String`|-|
|test|`char symbol`|`Action`|`TransitionNotFound`|

The [TransitionNotFound](./lib/src/main/java/machine/exceptions/TransitionNotFound.java) exception is for transitions that doesn't exist for a given input char.

---

#### Automaton

| method |  arguments | returns |throws|
|--------|------------|---------|------|
|constructor|`State[] states`, `String tape`|-|`FirstStateException`, `InvalidTape`|
|getTape|-|`String`|-|
|test|-|`boolean`|`TransitionNotFound`|

The [InvalidTape](./lib/src/main/java/machine/exceptions/InvalidTape.java) exception is raised when the given tape has no symbols into.

---

### Example

this is an example of a automaton architecture:
![example](./assets/snippet.png)

relative automaton:

![automaton](./assets/example.svg)

Note that the `&` marks the start of the tape and the `n` in the code is the same as $\epsilon$ (empty space) in the diagram.

This example searches for sequences as:

```plaintext
aaabbb
aabb
ab
```

and the input tapes looks like:

```plaintext
# code
&aabbn

# automaton
&aabbœµ
```

[`Note: There's an example code in /lib/src/test/examples/App.java check it out`](./lib/src/test/examples/App.java)

## Installation

To install the `machine` library, follow the instruction at [github packages](https://github.com/Dpbm/turing-machine/packages/1996975), you may need [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for that.

You can also install maven as an `ASDF` plugin:

- [maven](https://github.com/Proemion/asdf-maven)

## Testing

After [installing gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) and cloning this repo, you can run the tests by doing:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Build

You can also build the project by your own, using:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Publishing

To publish this package to a github package, you need to add a `classic token` to you account, and grant the access to read and write packages, to do that take a look at: [github article](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-java-packages-with-gradle).

After that, export the `GH_USERNAME` and the `GH_TOKEN` to your environment variables, like:

```bash
export GH_USERNAME="username"
export GH_TOKEN="gh_token"
```

Also, you'll need a `GPG` key to sign the package, follow [the official instructions](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html) to ensure that.

Then, run the `gradle publish` to publish to gh packages.

```bash
./gradlew publish
```

alternatively, you can pass the variables along with the `gradlew` command:

```bash
GH_USERNAME="username" GH_TOKEN="gh_token" ./gradlew publish
```
